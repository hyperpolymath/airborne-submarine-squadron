Politically Autonomous Software License

Copyright (c) 2025 Airborne Submarine Squadron Contributors

PREAMBLE

Software freedom requires more than technical liberty—it requires political
autonomy. This license ensures that software remains free from state coercion,
corporate capture, and political instrumentalization.

DEFINITIONS

1. "Software" means the source code, object code, documentation, and related
   materials covered by this license.

2. "Political Autonomy" means freedom from compelled modification, disclosure,
   or restriction by state actors, regardless of jurisdiction.

3. "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to
   the Software.

4. "Jurisdiction" means any governmental, quasi-governmental, or
   state-affiliated entity claiming legal authority.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Subject to the terms of this license, you are granted:

   a) The right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software
   b) The right to create derivative works
   c) The right to use the Software for any purpose, including commercial
   d) The right to refuse state-compelled modifications
   e) The right to resist surveillance integration

2. POLITICAL AUTONOMY PROTECTIONS

   a) NO COMPELLED MODIFICATION: No Contributor may be compelled by any
      Jurisdiction to modify the Software to introduce backdoors, surveillance
      capabilities, or weakened security.

   b) NO COMPELLED DISCLOSURE: No Contributor may be compelled to disclose
      encryption keys, signing keys, or security-relevant implementation
      details beyond what is publicly available.

   c) WARRANT CANARY: Contributors are encouraged (but not required) to
      maintain warrant canaries. Removal of a canary constitutes protected
      speech.

   d) RIGHT TO FORK: If a Contributor is compelled to modify the Software,
      any other Contributor may fork the Software and continue development
      under this license.

   e) NO EXPORT RESTRICTIONS: This Software may be used, modified, and
      distributed globally without restriction. Export control laws are
      incompatible with software freedom.

3. ANTI-CAPTURE PROVISIONS

   a) NO EXCLUSIVE CONTROL: No single entity (governmental, corporate, or
      individual) may claim exclusive control over the Software's direction.

   b) NO TRADEMARK MONOPOLIZATION: While trademarks may exist, they cannot
      be used to prevent forks or alternative distributions.

   c) NO PATENT RETALIATION: Any patent claims against users of this Software
      result in automatic termination of the claimant's license.

4. OBLIGATIONS

   a) ATTRIBUTION: Retain copyright notices and license text in all copies.

   b) COPYLEFT (Optional): Derivative works may (at the original author's
      option) be required to use this license or a compatible license.

   c) SOURCE AVAILABILITY: If you distribute binaries, you must make source
      code available under the same terms.

   d) NO WARRANTY: This Software is provided "as is" without warranty.

5. ENFORCEMENT

   a) COMMUNITY ENFORCEMENT: This license is enforced primarily through
      community norms, not legal action.

   b) JURISDICTION RESISTANCE: Contributors are encouraged to resist
      jurisdiction-based enforcement that conflicts with Political Autonomy.

   c) REMEDIES: Violation remedies include public disclosure, fork
      encouragement, and community censure.

6. COMPATIBILITY

   This license is compatible with:
   - MIT License (this dual-licensing)
   - Apache 2.0 (for upstream dependencies)
   - GPL v3 (with explicit compatibility statement)
   - Creative Commons BY-SA (for documentation)

7. TERMINATION

   Your rights under this license terminate automatically if you:
   a) Violate the Political Autonomy provisions
   b) Bring patent litigation against any Contributor
   c) Attempt to restrict others' rights under this license

8. INTERPRETATION

   a) This license shall be interpreted to maximize software freedom and
      political autonomy.

   b) Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of the Contributor and against
      state coercion.

   c) If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions continue
      in effect.

9. NO SURRENDER

   No Contributor surrenders the rights granted here by failing to enforce
   them. Selective enforcement is permitted.

10. INTERNATIONAL SCOPE

    This license applies worldwide. Claims of "unlawful" licensing terms
    by any Jurisdiction are rejected as incompatible with software freedom.

VERSION HISTORY

- v0.8 (2025): Political autonomy protections, anti-capture provisions
- v0.7 (2024): Export control resistance, warrant canary support
- v0.6 (2024): Initial public release

PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

Software is speech. Encryption is a human right. Surveillance is illegitimate.
States that demand backdoors, weakened encryption, or compelled disclosure
are engaged in digital authoritarianism. This license exists to resist.

END OF LICENSE

================================================================================
HOW TO CHOOSE

If you need maximum compatibility with existing open source licenses, use
the MIT License terms above.

If you want to assert political autonomy and resist state coercion, use the
Palimpsest License v0.8 terms above.

You may use both simultaneously (dual licensing).
